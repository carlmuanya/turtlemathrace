# turtlemathrace
My program was created using the random and turtle python libraries. The game is a game meant for children learning simple math. There are 3 players. One player will be selected out of the three to go each time randomly. The player will be given a random math problem and if it is answered correctly, the player will advance, if not, another player will again be selected randomly. The first player to reach the finish line will win the game.
